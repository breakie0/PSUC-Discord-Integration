# PSUC-Discord-Integration
A simple app that gives Phantasy Star Universe Discord Rich Presence (Shows what you are upto whilst playing the game).

# Installation
- Download and open the PSU-DRP Installer
  - The installer path should be pointed toward you PSUC.exe directory by default
  - If you're playing Clementine the directory might look something like this "C:\Users\Username\AppData\Local\Programs\Phantasy Star Universe Clementine".
  - if you have installed the game in a alternative location that is where the path should be pointed.
  - Download and install, there should be a popup that states the files are installed correctly. The file should be PSU-DRP.exe

- Run the PSU-DRP.exe as administrator

- Make sure the Game Path is correctly pointing to the PSUC.exe.
  - If you're using an alternative exe or using a launcher you redirect the path to that instead.

- Press Launch
    - If it isn't showing up in Discord try these:
      - Open Discord User Settings -> Activity Settings -> Registered Games -> "Not seeing your game? Add it!" and make sure to select "Phantasy Star Universe DRP" Not the game itself!
      - Make sure your Activity Privacy is on User Settings -> Activity Settings -> Activity Privacy -. "Share your detected activities with others"

# Other Notes
If you have the game open already, opening this app and pressing launch should attach itself to PSU automatically

If you have any crashes or bugs please leave them in the issues tab, I created this in 1 evening so there might be a bug or 2!
