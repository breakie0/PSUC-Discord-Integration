# PSUC-Discord-Integration
A simple app that gives Phantasy Star Universe Discord Rich Presence (Shows what you are upto whilst playing the game).

# Installation
- Download and open the PSU-DRP Installer.
  - The installer path should be pointed toward your PSUC.exe directory by default.
  - If you're playing Clementine the directory might look something like this "C:\Users\Username\AppData\Local\Programs\Phantasy Star Universe Clementine".
  - if you have installed the game in an alternative location, that is where the path should be pointed.
  - Press the Download and install button, there should be a popup that states the files are installed correctly. The file created should be named PSU-DRP.exe.
  - You can close the installer now.

- Run PSU-DRP.exe as administrator.

- Make sure the Game Path is correctly pointing to the PSUC.exe in the PSU-DRP.exe.
  - If you're using an alternative exe or using a launcher you can redirect the path to that instead.

- Press Launch
    - If Discord isn't showing DRP try the following:
      - Open Discord User Settings -> Activity Settings -> Registered Games -> "Not seeing your game? Add it!" and make sure to select "Phantasy Star Universe DRP" Not the game itself!
      - Make sure your Activity Privacy is on User Settings -> Activity Settings -> Activity Privacy -. "Share your detected activities with others"

# Other Notes
If you have the game open already, opening this app and pressing launch should attach itself to PSU automatically

If you have any crashes or bugs please leave them in the issues tab, I created this in 1 evening so there might be a bug or 2!
