# PSUC-Discord-Integration
A simple app that launches gives Phantasy Star Universe Discord Rich Presence (Shows what you are upto whilst playing the game).

# Installation
- Download and unzip into your Phantasy Star Universe game directory
  - If you're playing Clementine the directory might look something like this "C:\Users\Username\AppData\Local\Programs\Phantasy Star Universe Clementine".
  - if you have installed the game in a alternative location that is where this app needs to go. 

- Run the app as administrator

- Make sure the Game Path is correctly pointing to the PSUC.exe.
  - If you're using an alternative exe or using a launcher you can point the path to that also and it should work fine.

- Press Launch
    - If you don't have Phantasy Star Universe DRP showing up the first time opening you need to point discord to the app.
      - Open Discord User Settings -> Activity Settings -> Registered Games -> "Not seeing your game? Add it!" and make sure to select "Phantasy Star Universe DRP" Not the game itself!

# Other Notes
If you have the game open already, opening this app and pressing launch should attach itself to PSU automatically

If you have any crashes or bugs please leave them in the issues tab, I created this in 1 evening so there might be a bug or 2!

If you're having an error message about the icon file being missing, you can download it from this repo and put it in the same folder as the PSU-DRP.exe
